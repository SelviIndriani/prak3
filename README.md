## Project Objective 
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis through MySQL of the Lown Hospital Index for Equity 2022 dataset and create a visually appealing and informative Tableau dashboard that showcase my findings. The analysis will focus on key metrics related to equity in healthcare, including Pay Equity, Community Benefit, and Inclusivity. By exploring these metrics, the project aims to gain insights into the extent of fairness, inclusiveness, and community engagement within hospitals.

## Steps Performed 
1. Downloaded the datasat and loaded it into Excel. Cleaned the dataset and when I felt it was ready, I converted the file into JSON to export it to MySQL

2. Utilized SQL analysis techniques to extract and organize relevant data from the Lown Hospital Index for Equity 2022 dataset.
   
3. Focused on the Equity measures, which consist of Pay Equity, Community Benefit, and Inclusivity indicators.

4. Analyzed the Inclusivity aspect by examining income inclusivity, racial inclusivity, and education inclusivity within hospitals.

5. Took a deep dive into the Tier 1 - Tier 4 rankings. Identified the top 10 and bottom 10 hospitals based on each ranking, as well as the number of hospitals corresponding to each grade. 
   
6. Designed and developed an interactive Tableau dashboard that presents the findings of the analysis in a visually engaging and user-friendly manner.

## Challenges 
During the project, I encountered a challenge related to acquiring the complete dataset for analysis. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, which included deleting and re-downloading the dataset, I noticed that I could only access about half of the data. Specifically, out of a total of 4000 rows, I was only able to obtain 1789 rows. This limitation had a notable impact on my analysis as it resulted in a reduced sample size, potentially leading to incomplete or skewed insights. The incomplete dataset hindered the ability to draw accurate conclusions and might have introduced bias in the analysis, thereby compromising the overall validity and reliability of the findings. This challenge highlights the importance of having full access to data sources during a project.
